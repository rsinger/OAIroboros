OAIroboros

OAIroboros is an OAI-PMH client designed to perform parallel requests against a single provider.  It uses Typhoeus for the HTTP client (therefore there is a curl dependency).  The expected use case for OAIroboros (vs., say, the much more mature and dependable ruby-oai gem) is to issue a ListSets request and then simultaneously run a ListIdentifiers or ListRecords request against that set list.

For example:

>> client = OAIroboros:Client.new("http://example.org/oai-pmh")

>> client.list_sets

  This doesn't actually issue the request, it just queues it.  To execute:

>> requests = client.run

  Which returns an array of issued request responses

>> requests.each do | request |
>>	request.handled_response.sets.each do | set |
>>		set.list_identifiers
>>	end
>> end

 This queues up a bunch of ListIdentifier requests.

>> list_ids = client.run

This returns an array of the queued ListIdentifier request responses.

Obviously, this has the power to absolutely melt a run of the mill OAI-PMH server (by default, it can send up to 200 parallel requests), so use with caution.
